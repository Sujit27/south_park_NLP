Now I know that choir tours are totally stupid and lame [she frowns], but please, give her your full attention. [to her] Go ahead.\\n', \"\\n Choir Teacher\\n Uh. Thank you, Mr. Garrison. [cheerfully] How are we all doing today?! [the kids' eyes wander] I can't hear you! I said, How are we all doing?!

[the others laugh]\\n', \"\\n Mr. Garrison\\n Kenny McCormick, you speak when you're spoken to!! [to the choir teacher] Go ahead.\\n\", '\\n Choir Teacher\\n You see, we take kids from all over the country and put them in a choir [Pip yawns and Bill notices. Clyde nods off] where we sing and dance to raise awareness about our vanishing rainforest.\\n', '\\n Choir Boy\\n [steps forward] Did you know over 10,000 acres of rainforest are bulldozed every year?\\n', \"\\n Choir Girl\\n [steps forward] That's right. And over 30% of the world's oxygen [Kenny sees her and begins to swoon] is made in the rainforest. [smiles back at him. Kenny's in love - ahem, distracted.

You just flipped me off again!\\n\", '\\n Craig\\n No I didn’t.\\n', \"\\n Mr. Mackey\\n Yes you did! And until you stop flipping people off, you can just go back to the waiting room, m'kay?! Next!

It just so happens that I\\'m on the board of directors.\\n', \"\\n Kyle\\n Dude! All those choirs are the same. They don't even really sing. They use pre-recorded tapes.\\n\", '\\n Mr. Mackey\\n Well, guess what, boys? I think that \"Getting Gay With Kids\" is just what you need.

Don't send us to that ole kids' choir. Have mercy, Mr. Mackey.\\n\", \"\\n\\n Kyle's house, some days later. The Get Gay With Kids bus pulls up to Kyle's house to pick up Kyle, Cartman, and Stan.\\n\", '\\n Sheila\\n Be safe, Kyle. Bring me something back from the rainforest.\\n', '\\n Choir Teacher\\n Oh, nonono. The rainforest is very fragile. We must take only pictures and leave only footprints.\\n', \"\\n Sheila\\n Oh, I didn't realize.\\n\", '\\n Choir Boy\\n Did you know that right now, bulldozers are tearing down thousands of acres of rainforest every day?\\n', '\\n Cartman\\n [as he enters the bus] Aw, man, this is gonna suck donkey balls.\\n', \"\\n Stan\\n [As Sharon drags him to the bus] Please don't make me go on a choir tour, Mom, please!\\n\", '\\n Sharon\\n Stan, you should be excited. I would love to see the rainforest. Besides, your dad and I need some time alone. [tosses him into the bus]\\n', '\\n Stan\\n Nooo-ho! [The door closes and the bus pulls away. Stan and Kyle look out the back window in dismay]\\n', \"\\n Choir Teacher\\n Okay, children, that's all of us. We're ready to head for the Latin American nation of Costa Rica, a country filled with virgin rainforest.\\n\", '\\n Cartman\\n Whoopee.\\n', \"\\n Choir Teacher\\n And you must be Eric Cartman. I've heard about you. You don't respect nature or other cultures.\\n\", '\\n Cartman\\n Yeah, pretty much.\\n', \"\\n Choir Teacher\\n Well, I'm gonna change the way you think, kiddo.\\n\", \"\\n Choir Girl\\n [Kenny sits next to her] My name's Kelly.\\n\", '\\n Kenny\\n My name’s Kenny.\\n', '\\n Kelly\\n Lenny?\\n', '\\n Kenny\\n No, Kenny.\\n', '\\n Kelly\\n Johnny?\\n', '\\n Kenny\\n KENNY!\\n', '\\n Kelly\\n Oh. [looks away and picks her nose.]\\n', \"\\n Choir Girl\\n Now, we've got a looong trip ahead of us, so let's take the opportunity to learn our choreography.\\n\", '\\n Cartman\\n [hushed] The nightmare begins.\\n', \"\\n\\n The bus rolls along. A map pops up, showing the bus's route, and Latin music plays. It crosses the border at Mexicali, goes down the Baja peninsula, takes a ferry to Mexico and cuts across the North to the Gulf, then snakes down Central America to Costa Rica. They arrive at San José.\\n\", \"\\n Choir Teacher\\n Oh, look, children! I think we're entering San José, which is the capital of Costa Rica. [the kids move to their windows and look out] Oh! This is so exciting!\\n\", '\\n Cartman\\n Oh my God! Dude, look at how dirty and crappy everything is!\\n', '\\n Choir Teacher\\n Eric, Costa Rica is a Third-World country. These people are much poorer than those in the U.S.\\n', \"\\n Cartman\\n Well, why the hell don't they get jobs?! [Throws open his window and yells] Ey! Why don't you people quit slacking off, and get a job! What's wrong with you?! Go to college!\\n\", '\\n Choir Teacher\\n Eric, sit down!\\n', \"\\n Cartman\\n [sits] Look, you've gotta be firm with these people or they just slack off and be poor forever. Right, Kenny? [Kenny looks at him angrily] Hey, maybe that's it, Kenny. Maybe you're Costa Rican; that's why your family's so poor.\\n\", \"\\n Kenny\\n [to Kelly] Argh! That's not true.\\n\", \"\\n Kelly\\n [picks her nose] Your family isn't poor? [picks her nose]\\n\", '\\n Cartman\\n Whoa, dude, look over there! [The bus stops. There are three women in front of a shop. A man has just dropped them off, pays them and drives away, and they wave at him.] Wow! Costa Rican prostitutes! Hey, look at the prostitutes, you guys!\\n', '\\n Redheaded Prostitute\\n [with heavy accent] What are chu looking at, man?\\n', \"\\n Middle Prostitute\\n Yeah, why don't chu take a peekture?\\n\", '\\n Cartman\\n Okay. [pretends] Cleek! [grins]\\n', '\\n Choir Teacher\\n Eric, SIT DOWN!\\n', '\\n\\n The bus stops at the Centro Nacional de Costa Rica and all exit.\\n', '\\n Choir Teacher\\n Kids, this is the Costa Rican Capitol building. This is where all the leaders of the Costa Rican government make their-\\n', '\\n Cartman\\n [rushing out] Oh my God, [covers his nose] it smells like ass out here.\\n', '\\n Choir Teacher\\n Alll right, that does it! [turns Cartman around] Eric Cartman, you respect other cultures this instant!\\n', \"\\n Cartman\\n [covers his nose again] I wasn't saying anything about their culture, I was just saying their city smells like ass.\\n\", '\\n Kelly\\n Wow, seeing a place like this really makes you appreciate living in America, huh?\\n', '\\n Kenny\\n [in bliss] Uh-huh. [Kelly picks her nose again]\\n', '\\n Choir Teacher\\n You may think that making fun of Third-World countries is funny, but let me-\\n', \"\\n Cartman\\n I don't think it's funny! This place is overcrowded, smelly, and poor! That's not funny, that sucks!\\n\", '\\n Choir Teacher\\n Eric, will you please, please, just keep your mouth shut while we present ourselves to the Costa Rican President?\\n', '\\n Cartman\\n Why?\\n', \"\\n Choir Teacher\\n Because I'll buy you some ice cream afterwards if you do.\\n\", '\\n Cartman\\n Eh-heheh!\\n', '\\n\\n Inside the Capitol. All seem to be facing the President.\\n', '\\n Choir Teacher\\n Well, it was a long trip, but the children are very excited to sing tomorrow.\\n', '\\n El Presidente\\n [long pause] ¿Qué?\\n', \"\\n Choir Teacher\\n Uh, we're, uh, we're the choir? That, that was sent from... the United States?\\n\", '\\n El Presidente\\n [long pause] ¿Qué?\\n', '\\n Choir Teacher\\n We\\'re the group singing for the \"Save The Rainforest\" summit tomorrow? [her head is cocked way to the left by now. El Presidente has no clue. Now the teacher is worried] Oh dear, where\\'s, where\\'s Mr. Mackey? He should have been here by now. [faces the kids] Children, do any of you speak Spanish? [Cartman waves his left arm] Don\\'t you dare! [the main door opens]\\n', \"\\n Mr. Mackey\\n [rushing in] Sorry I'm late.\\n\", \"\\n Choir Teacher\\n Ogh! Thank goodness you're here; I don't speak any Spanish.\\n\", '\\n Mr. Mackey\\n Oh, no problem.

Save The Rainforest.\\n', '\\n Choir Teacher\\n Yeess!\\n', '\\n El Presidente\\n Pablo los llevará en un tur de la jungla. [Pablo appears]\\n', '\\n Mr. Mackey\\n Uh, he says Pablo here will take you on a rainforest tour.\\n', '\\n Choir Teacher\\n Oh boy! Mr. Presidente, round up your subjects outside. We have a special gift for you. The gift... uh-of song. [moves aside]\\n', '\\n El Presidente\\n [long pause] ¿Qué?\\n', '\\n\\n On the Capitol steps.\\n', \"\\n Choir Teacher\\n All right, children, Let's get in our rows quickly, so we can begin.\\n\", '\\n Kelly\\n [walks over to Kenny, her partner] Did you remember all the choreography, Lenny?\\n', '\\n Kenny\\n Yeah, I think so.\\n', '\\n Choir Teacher\\n Hello, everybody. This is just a little rehearsal for tomorrow, so we may be a little rusty. [chuckles and shrugs. The people just look. She presses the play button. The kids begin to dance to the music]\\n', \"\\n The Tape\\n \\n\\n[Intro] Tootin' tootin' to, tada choo choo wow!\\n[Men sing]There's a place that is magical, and full of rain.\\n[Women sing] But now it needs help, because it is in pain.\\n[Men sing] Cleaning the earth is a mighty big chore\\n[All sing] We're spreading awareness like never before!\\n[Chorus] Getting Gay With Kids is here!

Yeah!\\nGetting Gay With Kids is here!\\nLet's save the rainforest! It's totally gay!\\nIt's totally gay!\\n[The kids regroup and Kyle stumbles into place. The tape is stopped and the subjects just walk away] \\n\\n\\n\", '\\n Choir Teacher\\n Great job, gang! You were really all over the place, Kyle.\\n', '\\n Kyle\\n Thanks!\\n', \"\\n Cartman\\n I told you Jewish people don't have rhythm!\\n\", '\\n Kyle\\n Fuck off, Cartman!\\n', '\\n Stan\\n No, dude! I think Cartman might actually be right.\\n', \"\\n Kyle\\n [alarmed] No! That's a stereotype.\\n\", \"\\n Stan\\n Dude! Maybe you really don't have any rhythm.

The choir teacher and her group are touring with Pablo.\\n', '\\n Pablo\\n This is now secondary rainforest we are entering. Notice the canopy of foliage.\\n', \"\\n Choir Teacher\\n Oh, it's everything I ever dreamed it would be!\\n\", \"\\n Kyle\\n God-damn, it's hot out here!\\n\", '\\n Stan\\n [sees a branch] Aaah! Snake!\\n', \"\\n Kyle\\n No, dude. That's a branch.\\n\", '\\n Stan\\n Oh. [sees it again] Aaah! Snake!\\n', \"\\n Kyle\\n No. That's the same branch again.\\n\", '\\n Stan\\n Oh.\\n', '\\n Pablo\\n [turns and stops the group] The rainforest is very delicate, and we must take steps to protect it.\\n', '\\n Cartman\\n [impatient] Yeah yeah yeah, take steps to protect it, blah blah blah. [Pablo looks at him] We hear this a million times back up in the States.\\n', '\\n Pablo\\n Here! Look! These are squirrel monkeys. [one sits in a tree, resting] Endangered inhabitants of the rainforest.\\n', \"\\n Kelly\\n Wow! Isn't he neat, Lenny? [takes a picture]\\n\", '\\n Cartman\\n [takes a branch and starts beating the monkey] Bad! Bad monkey! [it screams in pain]\\n', '\\n Choir Teacher\\n Eric, what the heck are you doing?? [the monkey flees]\\n', \"\\n Cartman\\n [stops] I'm asserting myself. It's tough love. Just like my Mr. Kitty. When he's bad I say, “Uh that a bad Mr. Kitty!” and I smack him on the head!\\n\", '\\n Pablo\\n And here is a three-toed sloth. [hangs from a branch with all four legs]\\n', \"\\n Cartman\\n [takes the branch and starts beating the sloth] It's bad! It's a bad three-toed sloth!\\n\", \"\\n Choir Teacher\\n [pulls him away] Eric, for God's sake, knock it off!!\\n\", '\\n Cartman\\n [throws the branch at the sloth] Re’spect my authoritah!\\n', \"\\n Choir Teacher\\n Well, Mr. Pedro, this was a great tour, but I guess we should be getting back. We have a big concert tomorrow, Don't we, kids?!\\n\", '\\n Kids\\n YEAH!\\n', '\\n Choir Boy\\n I wish we could have seen the Yanogapa.\\n', \"\\n Kyle\\n What's the Yanogapa?\\n\", '\\n Choir Teacher\\n The Yanogapa are gentle native people that live in the rainforest, but bulldozers are destroying their homes. Soon, they will have nowhere to go. So we must stop bulldozing the rainforest so that they can live-!\\n', '\\n Cartman\\n [fed up, buries his face in his mitts] Aagh Ghyod, here she goes again!!\\n', '\\n Stan\\n AAAAAAA! [hides behind a girl]\\n', '\\n Choir Teacher\\n Stanley, what is it?\\n', '\\n Stan\\n SNAAAKE! [all see and gasp]\\n', '\\n Pablo\\n [standing next to the snake wrapped around a tree trunk] Oh, yes. Uh this is what we call a coral snake. Notice the red markings. Quite an amazing creature.\\n', '\\n Stan\\n AAAAAAA! [runs farther back]\\n', \"\\n Pablo\\n What's the matter, little boy?\\n\", \"\\n Cartman\\n He's a little wuss, what's it look like? [Stan is hiding behind some foliage]\\n\", \"\\n Stan\\n [lifts some away] I'm just a-scared of snakes.\\n\", '\\n Pablo\\n Naw, naw. You must remember. This snake is more afraid of us than we are of it. [the snake jumps out of the tree and wraps itself around him, suffocating him] Oh!! [the snake bites him all over the face. Stan looks and drops the foliage so as to hide, and Pablo falls] Agh.\\n', '\\n Choir Teacher\\n [in horror] Oh my God!! [the snake starts swallowing Pablo]\\n', '\\n Cartman\\n Yeah, that snake is really scared of us all right!\\n', \"\\n Choir Teacher\\n [petrified] Jesus Christ, is he dead?! [Pablo's bones come out of the snake's anus]\\n\", '\\n Stan\\n Dude!\\n', '\\n Kyle\\n My guess would be yes.\\n', \"\\n Choir Teacher\\n Oh, no! God, no, no! [spins around] Don't panic, children.\\n\", \"\\n Cartman\\n [beats the snake, which turns and comes at him] Bad! That's a bad snay-ah! [hurries away, and the snake gives chase]\\n\", '\\n\\n The sun sets over the rainforest. The choir teacher now guides the group…\\n', \"\\n Choir Teacher\\n Maybe we came from that way. [points to her left] No, nno. Let's try this way. [points to her right and moves that way]\\n\", \"\\n Kelly\\n [walking behind Kenny] Benny? Do you think we're gonna be okay?\\n\", '\\n Kenny\\n [stops] Yeah. Everything is fine.\\n', \"\\n Kelly\\n That's good. Can I tell you something?\\n\", '\\n Kenny\\n Okay.\\n', '\\n Kelly\\n I think I like you. [holds his shoulder]\\n', '\\n Kenny\\n Really?!\\n', '\\n Kelly\\n [releases] Yeah. I mean, I think we communicate really well.\\n', \"\\n Kenny\\n Oh, that's great!\\n\", \"\\n Kelly\\n [looks away] No, that's not good.\\n\", \"\\n Kenny\\n That's not good?\\n\", \"\\n Kelly\\n No. See, if I start to like you too much, [looks away] I'm only going to get my heart broken. 'Cause we live on opposite ends of the country. [looks at him again] Once this choir tour is over, we'll never see each other again. [grabs him and gets emotional] And that would devastate me. [lets go] So I can't have any feelings for you, I just can't, Lenny! [walks away]\\n\", '\\n Kenny\\n [pissed] Aaaargh!\\n', '\\n Choir Teacher\\n Oh, children, the sun is setting. We have to find our way out of here quick!\\n', '\\n\\n The sun sets and the moon appears over the rainforest. Lightning flashes and the camera slowly drops to ground cover.\\n', '\\n Choir Teacher\\n Whoa-kay, okay, everything is just fine, kids. Now it is important that we all stick together. Is everybody still here?\\n', '\\n A Boy\\n I’m not.\\n', \"\\n Choir Teacher\\n Who's not?!\\n\", '\\n A Boy\\n Me.\\n', \"\\n Kelly\\n Benny, will you hold my hand? [picks her nose. When she lowers her hand, Kenny grabs it, but she looks away] I don't want to get emotionally attached, though.\\n\", '\\n Stan\\n Oh my God, dude!! I just saw Tony Danza!!\\n', '\\n\\n Lightning flashes and the group is seen sitting in a row on the ground with Tony Danza visible seated in the middle next to the choir teacher.\\n', \"\\n Choir Teacher\\n No, you didn't just see Tony Danza, Stanley.\\n\", '\\n\\n Next day. The sun rises over the Centro Nacional. A rooster crows. A massive stage is prepared for the Save the Rain Forest summit. It looks like an amphitheater, with a scaffold holding ten speakers over the stage and bullhorns atop the pillars. Balloons and a Save the Rain Forest banner are also anchored to the scaffold.\\n', '\\n El Presidente\\n [on stage] Bueno, bueno. Pongan el arcoiris al lado de las tortugas muertas. (Put the rainbow next to the picture of dying sea turtles.) [the worker moves along]\\n', '\\n Mr. Mackey\\n [approaching] Buenos dias, Señor Presidente, ¿mbien? (Hello, El Presidente)\\n', '\\n El Presidente\\n ¿Qué tal? ¿Está todo bien? (Oh hello. Is everything going okay?)\\n', \"\\n Mr. Mackey\\n Uh, muy bien. Señor Presidente, um... ¿Usted no ha visto el coro, no, mm-hm bien? (Oh fine, fine... You, uh, haven't seen the choir have you?)\\n\", '\\n El Presidente\\n ¡¿QUÉ?! (WHAT?!)\\n', '\\n Mr. Mackey\\n Parece que anoche no regresaron al hotel, hmbien. (Well, they never came back to the hotel last night...)\\n', \"\\n El Presidente\\n ¡¿Está bromeando, Mackey?! ¡¡¡Más de cien mil personas atenderán este evento!!! ¡¿Y me dice usted que no tendré a mis chiquitos lindos para que les canten?!

Are you telling me that I have no darling little kids to sing to them?!)\\n\", \"\\n Mr. Mackey\\n Estoy seguro que-uh-mmm, que-aaah llega- llegarán. No se preocupe. Eh, olvidelo, ¿yeah-mbien? (I am sure they'll get here. No problem, forget I said anything.)\\n\", '\\n\\n At the same time, in the rainforest, the group rises and marches on.\\n', \"\\n Kyle\\n Dude, we're totally lost! We're gonna die out here!\\n\", '\\n Kelly\\n We are?\\n', \"\\n Choir Teacher\\n Don't worry, Kelly. We're gonna find our way out of the rainforest and make it back to the concert in time. We just need to respect our mother rainforest so that she will respect us.\\n\", '\\n Kyle\\n Miss Stevens, you have a bug on your back.\\n', '\\n Miss Stevens\\n Oh, really? Could you brush it off? [shows her backpack, and a huge insect half her size growls on it]\\n', '\\n Kyle\\n Um, no.\\n', '\\n Miss Stevens\\n [panics] Oh, boy oh!! Oh my God, get it off me!! For the love of God, get it off me!! Oh my God!! [the insect growls and falls silent. Miss Stevens returns] Oh-okay, children. We must understand that the insects of the rainforest help the delicate balance of life here. [sees the insect, still on her back] Oh my God!! [runs off]\\n', '\\n Kyle\\n Rainforests suck! I wanna go home!\\n', '\\n Kelly\\n Me, too! [the rest start to groan]\\n', \"\\n Miss Stevens\\n Shh. Children, okay, let's try to listen to what the rainforest tells us.

I think we should get the hell out of here.\\n', \"\\n Miss Stevens\\n Now kids, let's be a bit more open-minded. I read all about this in Newsweek; this is a people's army.

You see, we're here to protest the government-sanctioned raping of your rainforest. [the soldiers just stare] We are fighters, just like you. Could you help us get back to San José? [no response] Um... [thinks] Oh, I know! Perhaps you would like a gift. Well, we have o-honly-hee one gift to give. The gift... of song [she moves aside]\\n\", '\\n Kids\\n Honh.

Everybody help the children!\\n', '\\n\\n More bulldozers enter and spread out. The workers go after the Yanogapa and chase them away. The children brighten up considerably. One bulldozer scoops up a group of Yanogapa and crushes them against a tree, killing them, then backs up over a coral snake, crushing it to bits, then rolls forward over a large insect, crushing it.\\n', '\\n Stan\\n Wow!\\n', '\\n Kyle\\n Dude! Bulldozers rule!\\n', \"\\n Foreman\\n [cutting the ropes off the kids] Come on!
